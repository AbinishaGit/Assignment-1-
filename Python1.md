# Compiler vs Interpreter Based Language
## Compiler:
A compiler translates the entire source code into machine code (or an intermediate code) before execution.
The compiled code is typically stored in a separate file, which can be executed directly by the machine.
### Examples: C, C++, Rust.

## Interpreter:
An interpreter translates and executes the source code line by line at runtime.
There is no separate compilation step; the code is executed directly from the source.
### Examples: Python, Ruby, JavaScript.

# Key Differences:
## Execution Speed: Compiled languages generally execute faster because the code is already translated into machine language. Interpreted languages may be slower due to the overhead of translating code at runtime.
## Portability: Interpreted languages are often more portable because the interpreter can run on different platforms, whereas compiled code is platform-specific.
## Development Cycle: Interpreted languages usually have a faster development cycle since thereâ€™s no need to compile the code before running it.
